# Personal Portfolio - Module 2, Mar 27

## Description
The aim of this project is to create a landing page for a portfolio. This is to be the starting point for a portfolio that will help with employment quests after the bootcamp is completed. While currently a landing page, once assignments are completed, it will be edited to showcase knowledge and growth.

## Code discovery
While working on a section of the page, issues arose when the screen would be minimized to a mobile viewing setting. The text would stretch out beyond the containter it was attached to, causing a horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the screen, as content was pushed out to the right-hand side.

The original HTML was written as:

<img src="./assets/images/Untitled.jpg" alt="html issue">


It was found out to be that *p* would work better thatn *pre* and be recognized in a way that would work with both the container and action so that no other elements were affected and the desired result shown.
